abstract: "Superposing two or more periodic structures to form moiré patterns is emerging as a promising platform to confine and manipulate light. However, moiré-facilitated interactions and phenomena have been constrained to the vicinity of moiré lattices. Here we report on the observation of ultralong-range coupling between photonic lattices in bilayer and multilayer moiré architectures mediated by dark surface lattice resonances in the vertical direction. We show that two-dimensional plasmonic nanoparticle lattices enable twist-angle-controlled directional lasing emission, even when the lattices are spatially separated by distances exceeding three orders of magnitude of lattice periodicity. Our discovery of far-field interlattice coupling opens the possibility of using the out-of-plane dimension for optical manipulation on the nanoscale and microscale."
