abstract: Superposing two or more periodic structures to form moiré patterns is
  emerging as a promising platform to confine and manipulate light. However,
  moiré-facilitated interactions and phenomena have been constrained to the
  vicinity of moiré lattices. Here we report on the observation of
  ultralong-range coupling between photonic lattices in bilayer and multilayer
  moiré architectures mediated by dark surface lattice resonances in the
  vertical direction. We show that two-dimensional plasmonic nanoparticle
  lattices enable twist-angle-controlled directional lasing emission, even when
  the lattices are spatially separated by distances exceeding three orders of
  magnitude of lattice periodicity. Our discovery of far-field interlattice
  coupling opens the possibility of using the out-of-plane dimension for optical
  manipulation on the nanoscale and microscale.
