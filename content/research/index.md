**Quantum-dot Plasmon Lasers**

We construct nanoscale lasers using novel light-emitting materials and plasmonic cavities. By near-field coupling of colloidal quantum dots (QDs) to metal nanoparticle lattices, we realized compact lasers with submicron device thicknesses. In contrast to current techniques that rely on bulky optical elements to achieve laser polarization control, this QD-plasmon hybrid material system can serve as a nanoscale light source to generate desired lasing polarization patterns. We revealed the optical feedback mechanism of this QD-plasmon laser where the conformal coating of QD films on metal nanoparticle lattices enables the formation of hybrid waveguide-surface lattice resonance modes. With a thorough understanding of the working principles, we further realized either radial or azimuthal polarization by controlling the thickness of the quantum dot film. Our work offers critical insights into how to manipulate the interaction between quantum emitters and optical cavities at the nanoscale, and offers prospects for applications in quantum communication and information.

**Plasmonic Metasurface Design**

  Our research team aim to design and develop multiscale living materials for bio-interfaces to meet emerging needs in **post-pandemics time**, from the **human-machine interface** in telemedicine, **biomedical therapy** to **sustainable agriculture**.   Living tissues are an integrated, multiscale architecture consisting of dense cell ensembles and extracellular matrices that cooperate to facilitate excellent self-organization, intercellular communication, and dynamic responsiveness.   Our research is based on the hypothesis that {{< hl >}}a improved bio-interfaces with biological systems can be achieved by formulating “living” materials with adaptability, dynamic responsiveness, and self-regeneration{{< /hl >}}. The living materials involves the integration of synthetic materials with living cells, or particles with biomimetic properties.  The development of such biomaterials for improved bio-interfaces demands new design principles for integrating living and dynamically responsive components that interact at different length and time scales. 

  The design and engineering of **adaptable**, **dynamically responsive**, **self-regenerative**, and **bio-integrative living materials** (a grand challenge in material science research) will advance applications that interface with biological systems, such as **telemedicine**, **biomedical therapy**, and **sustainable agriculture**.
