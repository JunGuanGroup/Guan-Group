**Quantum-dot Plasmon Lasers**

We construct nanoscale lasers using novel light-emitting materials and plasmonic cavities. By near-field coupling of colloidal quantum dots (QDs) to metal nanoparticle lattices, we realized compact lasers with submicron device thicknesses. In contrast to current techniques that rely on bulky optical elements to achieve laser polarization control, this QD-plasmon hybrid material system can serve as a nanoscale light source to generate desired lasing polarization patterns. We revealed the optical feedback mechanism of this QD-plasmon laser where the conformal coating of QD films on metal nanoparticle lattices enables the formation of hybrid waveguide-surface lattice resonance modes. Either radial or azimuthal polarization can be realized by controlling the thickness of the quantum dot film. We also revealed that high-symmetry points in the reciprocal space of plasmonic nanoparticle lattices can support lasing at well-defined angles. By changing the periodicity of the plasmonic lattices or the thickness of the QD film, we engineered the optical band structure for controllable lasing direction. Our work offers critical insights into how to manipulate the interaction between quantum emitters and optical cavities at the nanoscale, and offers prospects for applications in quantum communication and information.

**Plasmonic Metasurface Design**

We develope creative approaches to realize multifunctional nanolasers. Through the discoveries of new optical modes – light-cone surface lattice resonances – in metal nanoparticle lattices, we have reported multi-color, in-plane emission from nanometer-scale thin laser devices. This study offers a design strategy to realize real-time tunable lasing colors by lattice rotation, which is not possible in conventional lasers. We realized a simultaneous red, green, and blue laser by combining a sandwiched lattice structure with a mixed dye solution. This work showed how lasing colors can be manipulated in compact architectures, which will be useful for display technologies, on-chip optical communications, and light-induced chemical reactions.

**Moiré Photonic Phenomena**

Our research team aim to design and develop multiscale living materials for bio-interfaces to meet emerging needs in **post-pandemics time**, from the **human-machine interface** in telemedicine, **biomedical therapy** to **sustainable agriculture**.   Living tissues are an integrated, multiscale architecture consisting of dense cell ensembles and extracellular matrices that cooperate to facilitate excellent self-organization, intercellular communication, and dynamic responsiveness.   Our research is based on the hypothesis that {{< hl >}}a improved bio-interfaces with biological systems can be achieved by formulating “living” materials with adaptability, dynamic responsiveness, and self-regeneration{{< /hl >}}. The living materials involves the integration of synthetic materials with living cells, or particles with biomimetic properties.  The development of such biomaterials for improved bio-interfaces demands new design principles for integrating living and dynamically responsive components that interact at different length and time scales.
