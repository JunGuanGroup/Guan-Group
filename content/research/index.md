  Our research team aim to design and develop multiscale living materials for bio-interfaces to meet emerging needs in **post-pandemics time**, from the **human-machine interface** in telemedicine, **biomedical therapy** to **sustainable agriculture**.   Living tissues are an integrated, multiscale architecture consisting of dense cell ensembles and extracellular matrices that cooperate to facilitate excellent self-organization, intercellular communication, and dynamic responsiveness.   Our research is based on the hypothesis that {{< hl >}}a improved bio-interfaces with biological systems can be achieved by formulating “living” materials with adaptability, dynamic responsiveness, and self-regeneration{{< /hl >}}. The living materials involves the integration of synthetic materials with living cells, or particles with biomimetic properties.  The development of such biomaterials for improved bio-interfaces demands new design principles for integrating living and dynamically responsive components that interact at different length and time scales.
