Dr. Jun GUAN (管君) obtained her bachelor’s degree in physics from Sichuan University in 2016. As part of her undergraduate studies, she was a visiting student at the University of Oxford (Aug 2015 – July 2016) and the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Feb 2015 – May 2015). She obtained her Ph.D. degree in applied physics at Northwestern University in 2021 under the supervision of Professor Teri W. Odom and Professor George C. Schatz. 
After graduation, she worked as a postdoctoral scholar at Northwestern University (2021-2022, advisor: Teri W. Odom) and then at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (2022-2023, advisor: Vladimir Bulović). 
Dr. Guan’s research focuses on the design of hybrid nanophotonic architectures to manipulate light-matter interactions and to enable optical devices with new functionalities. 
She has published first-author papers in journals including *Nature Nanotechnology*, *Chemical Reviews*, *Advanced Materials*, *ACS Nano*, and *Nano Letters*, and has been invited to speak at international conferences including the Gordon Research Conference, the SPIE Optics and Photonics, and the Molecular Foundry’s annual meeting at the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.
