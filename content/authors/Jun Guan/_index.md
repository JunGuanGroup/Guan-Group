Jun Guan (管君) joined the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, as an assistant professor from July 2023. She obtained her bachelor’s degree in Physics from Sichuan University in 2016; as part of her undergraduate studies, she was a visiting student at the University of Oxford and the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. She obtained her Ph.D. degree in Applied Physics at Northwestern University in 2021 under the supervision of Prof. Teri W. Odom and Prof. George C. Schatz. After graduation, she worked as a postdoctoral scholar at Northwestern University (2021-2022, advisor: Teri W. Odom) and then at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (2022-2023, advisor: Vladimir Bulović). 

Prof. Guan’s research focuses on the design of plasmonic lattice architectures to manipulate light-matter interactions and to enable laser devices with diverse functionalities. She has published first-author papers in journals including *Nature Nanotechnology*, *Chemical Reviews*, *Advanced Materials*, *ACS Nano*, and *Nano Letters*, and has been invited to give research talks at international conferences including the Gordon Research Conference, the SPIE Optics and Photonics, and the Molecular Foundry’s annual meeting at the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.
